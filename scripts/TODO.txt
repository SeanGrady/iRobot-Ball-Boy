test argparse in CV node to handle whether it's an arm camera or a front camera
use namespacing and remapping so that different vision nodes publish on different topics (arm_vision vs front_vision)
modify time_avg_balls to do something more intelligent than just checking if x, y and r have been in a range for 10 frames
    specifically, it should actually average the radii and centers of the circles, most likely
    probably differentiate between different balls from frame to frame by finding the nearest visible circle? not sure about this one...should get it working with one ball first
figure out a better way to deal with point-like objects than defining them in many separate files
